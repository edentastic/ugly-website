    <h1>I like to go rock climbing</h1>
    <div id='gym'>
        <h2>Usually I go to the gym and climb</h2>
        <img src="images\vertical-adventures.jpg" alt="Vertical Adventures in Columbus, Ohio" />
        <p>(this is a picture of my gym. I'm not in it though)</p>
    </div>
    <div id='rock'>
        <h2>Luckily, I also live where I can go outside and climb on real rocks</h2>
        <img src="images\rock.jpg" alt="just a rock">
        <p>(this is a picture of a rock. Not one I've climbed though)</p>
    </div>
    <div id='gear'>
        <h2>I've got all kinds of gear to climb safely, some of it gets used more than others</h2>
        <img src="images\quickdraws.jpg" alt="quick draws">
        <p>These are my quickdraws, back when I first got them. They're much more beat up.</p>
        <img src="images\ohm.jpg" alt="ohm">
        <p>This is my Ohm. Also well used, it helps me not kill my small belayers when I fall</p>
        <img src="images\nuts.jpg" alt="nuts">
        <p>These are nuts, I don't actually really know how to use them yet. They were a gift, but it was still probably
            premature</p>
        <img src="images\alpine-draws.jpg" alt="alpine draws">
        <p>These are alpine draws. I've used a few of them on a couple occasions, but again, probably an overzealous
            purchase </p>
    </div>
    <div id='hocking-hills'>
        <h2>For any Ohio folk who happen to see this, there's some climbing in Hocking Hills. It's not that good, but
            it's there!</h2>
        <img src="images\hocking-hills.jpg" alt="Bernal at Hocking hills">
        <p>That's my friend sitting in front of the wall at Hocking Hills. It was fun, but I don't have any pictures of
            anybody actually on it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id='mad-river'>
        <h2>Mad River Gorge is only an hour away. It's kind of lame, but I love it dearly</h2>
        <img src="images\drop-zone.jpg" alt="drop zone">
        <p>This is me on a route in the mad called "Drop Zone." From what I remember it was fun, but very cold that day.
        </p>
        <img src="images\rachael-allie.jpg" alt="Rachael and Allie">
        <p>Here are my friends Rachael and Allie about to climb something or other. Pretty sure it's either "Jacob's
            Ladder," or "Raining Buckeye"</p>
    </div>
    <div id="red-river">
        <h2>4 Hours away im Kentucky is a world-class climbing destination: the Red River Gorge!</h2>
        <img src="images\send-me.jpg" alt="Send me on my way">
        <p>Lots of fun memories here, this is when I climbed "Send Me On My Way" on my first trip to the Red</p>
    </div>
    <div id="new-river">
        <h2>Also 4 hours away from my home is the New River Gorge, yet another world-class climbing destination</h2>
        <img src="images\bouldering.JPG" alt="boulder">
        <p>You don't always get high off the ground. Here's some guys I know working on the boulder problem "Mechanical
            Sensei"</p>
        <img src="images\girl-boner.jpeg" alt="Girl Boner">
        <p>The New is my favorite place to climb. Credit my pal Lauren for this sick photo of me on the embarassingly
            named route "Girl Boner"</p>
        <p>I spent 10 days in the New right before my Tech Elevator cohort started, it was pretty rad.</p>
    </div>
    <div id='horseshoe'>
        <h2>Last Spring I took a big trip to Arkansas and spent a week climbing in Horseshoe Canyon</h2>
        <img src="images\horseshoe1.JPG" alt="thomas in horseshow">
        <p>MY bud Thomas on some random rocks. No idea what this route is. </p>
        <img src="images\downtime.JPG" alt="relaxing">
        <p>Also lots of down time on climbign trips. Part of the fun. </p>
